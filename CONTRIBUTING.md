## For Developers
1. Read the [style guidelines](https://github.com/SpirX/SpirX/blob/master/Documentation/StyleGuide.md).
2. Fork our [repository](https://github.com/SpirX/SpirX).
3. [Fix bugs](#Bug-Fixing), [improve code quality](#Quality-Standards), [develop new features](#Feature-Development), or [review others' code](#Code-Review).

#### Bug Fixing
The easiest way to start helping is by fixing bugs. Bugs that are marked [confirmed](https://github.com/SpirX/SpirX/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22confirmed%22) should be your first priority as they've been verified to exist. [Entry level](https://github.com/SpirX/SpirX/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22entry%20level%22%20) bugs are also good to start with as they will help introduce you to the codebase.

#### Quality Standards
Cleaning up messy code is another way to contribute. Code that is designed to be a placeholder should not exist in the repository for long, as other code may become dependent on the placeholder implementation.

Aside from cleaning up messy code, writing test cases is always welcome.

#### Feature Development
Once you've become accustomed to the code, you can begin contributing new features. Features are listed in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/SpirX/SpirX/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22feature%22). You should develop features according to what [milestone](https://github.com/SpirX/SpirX/milestones) they are a part of, as we won't publish a full release of features until the milestone they are a part of is fully completed.

#### Code Review
Before code can be accepted into the repository, they must be tested and reviewed by another contributor. Anyone is welcome to review changes and test new code.

## For Users
1. Download a [release](#) or [build the latest version](#).
2. Use it in your project and let us know [how it works](#Testing)

#### Testing
By using SpirX in your project, you can help find bugs for developers to fix. You can post a bug in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/SpirX/SpirX/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22bug%22).
